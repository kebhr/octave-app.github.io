A beta release for Octave.app version 4.4.1-u2 is now available. You can download it from our [Developer Downloads page](/Developer-Downloads.html), or directly [here](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases/download/v4.4.1-u2-beta1/Octave-4.4.1-u2-beta1.dmg).

We appreciate bug reports and other feedback, which you can leave on [the Octave.app Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/issues).

Version 4.4.1-u2 is a packaging update for Octave 4.4.1. It includes a hack to Qt to fix an issue with spurious "FSEvents sync assertion failed" warnings in the command window.
