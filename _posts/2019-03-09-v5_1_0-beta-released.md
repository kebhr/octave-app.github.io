title: Octave.app 5.1.0 beta releases available
---

Beta releases for Octave.app version 5.1.0 are now available. You can download them from our [Developer Downloads page](/Developer-Downloads.html), or from the [5.1.0 beta1 Release page](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/releases/tag/v5.1.0-beta1) on GitHub.

We appreciate bug reports and other feedback, which you can leave on [the Octave.app Issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app/issues).

The new 5.x series of GNU Octave has several new features, which you can read about in the [Octave 5.1 Release Notes](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/NEWS-5.1.html).

The 5.1 packaging of Octave.app now includes a Java JDK bundled with the installation, so you no longer have to manage the installation of a separate JDK to enable Java support in Octave.
