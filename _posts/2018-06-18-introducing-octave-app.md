title: Introducing the Octave.app Organization
---

Octave.app is a new open source project dedicated to producing Mac native app distributions of [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). Find us on GitHub at the [octave-app](https://github.com/octave-app/) organization, or on our web page at <https://octave-app.github.io>.

We are not an official GNU or GNU Octave project. We are a group of interested Octave users who work on Macs, and want to see an easy-to-use Mac distribution of Octave made available. We are building an Octave.app bundler system based on the [install_octave.sh](https://github.com/schoeps/octave_installer) work of [Sebastian Schoeps](https://github.com/schoeps) and will be distributing Octave.app builds made with it.

We are currently in the process of setting up our build and hosting infrastructure, and working on a build of Octave 4.4.0. In the mean time, old downloads of Octave.app 4.0.3 are available on our [Downloads page](/Downloads.html).

If you have questions about the project or are interested in contributing, please contact <octave-app@apjanke.net>.
