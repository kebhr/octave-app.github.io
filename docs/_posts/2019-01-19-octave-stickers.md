title: Free Octave Logo Stickers
---

I had a bunch of Octave logo stickers printed up, and I have way more than I can use. These are 2" die-cut stickers from StickerMule based on the [Octave logo SVG](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gnu-octave-logo.svg), and they look great on laptops.

Want some? Send an email to floss@apjanke.net with your mailing address and the number of stickers you want (up to 5, unless you have a special reason to want more), and I'll mail you some.
