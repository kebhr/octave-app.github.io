The Octave.app project is hosted on GitHub under the [octave-app organization](https://github.com/octave-app).

Please remember that we are just a packager of GNU Octave, and do not develop Octave ourselves. Problems with the native Mac app or installer/DMG should be reported to us. Problems with GNU Octave itself should be reported [upstream to GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

Problems with Octave.app? Report a bug on [octave-app](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app).

Problems with `octave-app-bundler`, the Octave.app bundling too? Report a bug on [octave-app-bundler](https://github.com/octave-app/octave-app).
