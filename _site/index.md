Octave.app
==========

Octave.app is a project to bundle and distribute [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) as a native Mac GUI application.

We are not an official GNU project, or part of GNU Octave. We are a rag-tag band of misfits who've written a tool to download and build GNU Octave and its dependencies and bundle them as a Mac app.

Our goal is to make ready-to-use Octave.app installers available to the public.

## Download

All Octave.app releases are available on the [Downloads](/Download.html) page.

## License

Most of Octave.app's code is GPL, with the exception of its Homebrew formula files, which are BSD 2-Clause License.

GNU Octave itself is GPL. Its dependencies are available under various FLOSS licenses.
